Coding Standards and Tutorials for Node Web Applications

## MVP

It's going to start off as a sort of wiki blog with small examples. I'm going to try and cover all aspects of creating Node Web Applications.
I will try and mention different approaches or useful libraries for each topic or piece of the application, and I will definitely go into depth about a preferred option. 

As the ecosystem changes (or as soon as I have codegret), I will update the wiki as appropriate. After some (arbitrary) marker of completeness is met, I will create some versioned branches for the wiki so there is a history of the changes.

## Version 1 and beyond

I will then try to add some links to repositories with working examples or examples in here with step by step walk-thrus and each chapter's code as branches, both complete and incomplete.

And who knows what else along the way. I may add useful gists, npm packages, boilerplate-code, cheatsheats, etc.

## Next steps

Head over to the [Wiki Blog Homepage](https://github.com/sampurcell/sfpcs/wiki) and check out current progress on the project.
